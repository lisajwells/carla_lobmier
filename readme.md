## Installation

```
npm install
bower install
npm run start
```

Make sure to use Node version `10`, as any other version will result in errors during install. Using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to switch between versions is recommended.

If the installation does throw errors, check if Xcode components need an update. Open Xcode and it will ask if you want to update.
