ShowFormResults.js
-------------------------------------------------------

This JavaScript was designed to be used with our NateMail.php form processing script from www.mindpalette.com

This version of the JavaScript will only work with NateMail versions 2.5 and greater.

This script is to be used in your custom redirect page to show the form submission values (form field names and values) on your page where you specify. To install the script, simply upload the ShowFormResults.js file into the same folder or directory as your redirect page.

Next, wherever you would like the form results displayed, paste this text into your HTML source code...

<script type="text/javascript" src="ShowFormResults.js"></script>

That should do it. You can also open the ShowFormResults.js file and specify CSS class names to control the appearance of the form field names and values independently. Specific instructions are commented into the script.
