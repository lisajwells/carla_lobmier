Test PHP Email

This utility will determine if your server is capable of sending out emails via PHP. To install, upload the php_mail_test.php file to your server to the same folder you'll be installing your PHP form processing script.

Use your web browser and browse to the php_mail_test.php file on your server. Enter your valid email address into the form and submit it to test the server status.

Some servers may require a different file extension to process PHP files, such as .php3 or .phtml - if this is the case (or web host will have to tell you), just change the extension on the php_mail_text.php file to whatever you need before uploading.
