        <p class="page-intro">For <i>Art in the Corner Room,</i> composer Michael Gatonska created six soundscapes to accompany the six sets of my watercolor vellum scrolls for <strong><i>Scrolling Confluence.</i></strong> The soundscapes appear on a YouTube channel that Michael set up for this project. Each soundscape is approximately 3-5 minutes in duration.</p>

        <p class="page-intro">For <i>Art Wall on Third,</i> composer Michael Gatonska created a soundscape to accompany my suite of watercolors on vellum for <strong><i>Scrolling Confluence: Supernova.</i></strong> The soundscape appears on a YouTube channel that Michael set up for this project. This soundscape runs a little over 7&frac12; minutes in duration.</p>
