        <h1>Art in the Corner Room</h1>

        <p class="page-intro">Scrolls, the format for my large-scale watercolor work painted on vellum, date back to ancient Egypt and precede bound books. <strong><i>Scrolling Confluence</i></strong> is a series of these watercolor pairs installed in <i>Art in the Corner Room,</i> Mid-Manhattan Library, NYC, January through May 2016. In the windows, one panel faces the street, while the other faces the interior, creating interplay between images that shift as the light shifts throughout the day. As the viewer moves clockwise facing 5th Avenue, imagery prompts a world narrative beginning with India and Egypt, continuing with Medieval manuscript illumination, the Renaissance, Japan and the final scrolls referencing the technologically-driven present. All the street-facing vellums are binary code messages with nodes to the culture of the pair. While I am looking at the history of scrolls and books, the history of art images and the vocabulary of painting are also being filtered through my own painterly response.</p>
