        <p>Comes a time to settle on a place. One's mind drifts and lifts and carries. The art is the evidence of the
            scurry as well as the travel. How to make the drift one's own? This can be clumsy business and requires
            protection of one's ideas, point-of-view, emotions and observations. Each painting must carry the memory of
            my own visual pleasure, but there must be something more for the picture to ignite. This search is also
            accompanied by a resting of the mind to invite contemplation. The equation is layered. While imagery and
            abstraction are often both featured in my painting, the subject is elliptical: inside/outside;
            stillness/motion; edge/reflection; water/air; layers/surface; flicker/expansion; internal/external.
        </p>
        <p>Pieces in a series suggest multiple views similar to an Asian scroll that unrolls and reveals. I work both
            with paintings in a series as well as large-scale watercolor vellum scrolls. Multiple points of view and
            shifting scale have long been among the pictorial devices in my work. The concepts of inside/outside, and
            exploiting dualities of looking, are part of both my watercolor and acrylic painting. Overlapping images in
            shifting scale suggesting multiple points of view are a metaphor of how I think we experience the world.
            Abstraction and representational forms are fused with the aim of metaphorical content.
        </p>
        <p>The vellum scrolls unfold in time before the eyes. Imagery shifts and connects as the viewer’s eyes travel
            with the horizontal or vertical scrolls (a format influenced by Japanese tradition) or from piece to piece
            in a vellum series (suggesting multiple views not unlike an Asian scroll as it unrolls and reveals). I rely
            on the viewer to look within the layers of the vellum paper to take in the imagery’s subtlety and
            transitions between paint, graphite, scale and the two surfaces.
        </p>
        <p>The painterly, layered surfaces of the acrylic paintings share the same co-existing multiple points of view
            as the watercolor work. The acrylic paintings start from an internal place and become external in the
            making. The watercolors begin with external observations (often, a place) and take form through an internal
            processing of what is seen.</p>
        <p>My painting is a critique of art lacking in visual mystery and expansiveness. Metaphor invites viewer private
            contemplation and drift. I hope to slow down the noise and create a paradoxical visual and intellectual
            space that privileges thinking and imagination. The beauty of metaphor in tandem with questions in an
            open-ended picture is a thread in the history of art that I want to catch hold of. In counterpart, the art
            should reflect its time. Recently, inside/outside has grown with content-sourcing outside myself. I am
            interested in how we connect as a community and how art might shape and improve the way we do so. How to
            create an intellectual exchange with a viewer within the context of the art piece, while still offering an
            immersive, private, meditative experience? How might a public project invite a shift in how a viewer sees
            himself/herself, others and the shared environment? I am curious about how the art can signal the tone for
            experience. Projects investigating the community in this way have broadened my relationship with my viewer.
            While my painting point of view includes the history of art and remains picture-making as metaphor, it now
            joins with a painting investigation that reflects its time.</p>
