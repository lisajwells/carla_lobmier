        <h1>Private Pandemic</h1>

        <p class="page-intro"><em>Botanical Alchemy</em> offers the juxtaposition of a painting depicting lilies growing
            up from bits of steel, next to a painting presenting my text as a meditation for renewal. Painting
            undertakes both capturing time experienced during the pandemic, and grasping it back.</p>

        <p>This piece began when I wrote the text. The imagery was imagined surrounding the words and divided between
            what the imagery might look like before the words were written and then after. Hence, the two companion
            canvases. The steel pieces were sewn to each canvas after the compositions were organized. Next, the
            paintings were developed with many layers of paint.</p>

        <p>The subject matter of the <em>Wait Around</em> series moves among objects - a shamrock plant, chandelier,
            falling leaves, leaky faucet, black cat, elliptical calendars and tallies - to a shadowy figure and serves
            as metaphor for the sensation of 2020. The act of painting converts days, time, numbers to images of private
            contemplation.</p>

        <p>This series was made on paper to allow for shifting compositions, as I considered the concepts for each piece
            as part of the set of six. Although each paintingâ€™s imagery was established, I examined how light and
            meaning might be shaped through the addition of collage papers to fine tune the pictures. The papers are my
            hand-painted pieces and are used to add light, remove light, create pattern and rhythm and provide further
            details. Detail in this work means both building somewhat chaotic movement and surface qualities, as well as
            providing information defining the content of each painting. Painting with pieces made for a flexible
            outcome for paintings conceived from definite ideas.</p>

        <p>Backing up in time, <em>Get Up, Stuck Inside, Halo, Rose-Colored Queens</em> and <em>FlipBook, March
            2020</em> were the first pieces I made during the lockdown in March of 2020. <em>FlipBook</em> was the
            start. Among the images representing this piece, is a detail supplying a companion text written by me. My
            text is offered as context for this time of making art in my studio.</p>
