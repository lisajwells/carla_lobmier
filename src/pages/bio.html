            <p>Carla Lobmier received BFA degrees (Painting, Art History) from Eastern Illinois University and her MFA
                (Painting & Drawing) from the University of Illinois. In 1999, she was awarded an APEX Studio Program
                residency, NYC, and moved to NYC where she has remained. She has lived and worked in Jackson Heights
                since 2000.</p>
            <p>Her paintings, drawings and collages have been exhibited nationally and internationally and are in the
                permanent collections of Tarble Arts Center, William Rainey Harper College, Sheldon Swope Museum, Lund &
                Company Inventions and Whirlpool Corporation. Solo watercolor exhibitions include <em>Love Letter (to
                    Light),</em> Memphis, TN, <em>Dirt, rock and far views,</em> Langston Hughes Cultural Center, NYC
                and <em>Not so fast,</em> Resobox Gallery, NYC. Site-speciﬁc watercolor installations titled <em>Scrolling
                    Conﬂuence</em> and <em>Supernova</em> for two locations at the Mid-Manhattan Library, NYC, were
                exhibited January-May 2016. Lobmier’s Queens Art Intervention collected text informed the art piece that
                she made for the Queens Museum group exhibition of the work of the 2017 QAI artists. <em>Grace In
                    Dwelling,</em> the book, was published by Ragged Sky Press on the occasion of the Queens Museum
                exhibition and includes detailed images of the painting of this same title, as well as text and
                photographs of interviewed participants from the QAI intervention.</p>
            <p><em>Shaping the Container,</em> an art and movement workshop inviting participants to engage with
                Lobmier’s art piece, <em>Next Thing I Know: Shaping the Container,</em> included a collaborator-guided
                moving response. <em>Shaping the Container</em> was supported by a Queens Council for the Arts 2018 New
                Works Grant.</p>
            <p><em>UnNatural Zoom: Everything Now,</em> a site-speciﬁc watercolor installation, was made possible
                through a 2021 City Artist Grant, NYC.</p>
