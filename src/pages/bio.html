	    <div class="medium-8 columns">

			<p>Carla Lobmier received BFA degrees (Painting, Art History) from Eastern Illinois University and her MFA (Painting & Drawing) from the University of Illinois. In 1999, she was nominated for and awarded an APEX ART C.P. Studio Program residency, NYC, and moved to NYC where she has remained. She has lived and worked in Jackson Heights since 2000.</p>

			<p>Her paintings, drawings and collages have been exhibited nationally and internationally and are in the permanent collections of Tarble Arts Center, William Rainey Harper College, Sheldon Swope Museum, Lund and Company Inventions, Whirlpool Corporation and the 25th Congressional District, NYC. Recent solo watercolor exhibitions include <strong><i>Love Letter (to Light),</i></strong> Memphis, TN, <strong><i>Dirt, rock and far views,</i></strong> Langston Hughes Library & Cultural Center, NYC and <strong><i>Not so fast,</i></strong> Resobox Gallery, NYC.</p>

			<p>Site-specific watercolor installations for two locations at the Mid-Manhattan Library, NYC, are on exhibition through May 2016. This work is titled <strong><i>Scrolling Confluence</i></strong> and <strong><i>Scrolling Confluence: Supernova.</i></strong> The project was deeply influenced by her love of the study of art history and how such study could weave into her own painting.</p>

			<p>Her fourteen-panel slate and mixed media installation piece titled <strong><i>I walk,walk looking for the spot</i></strong> was exhibited with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan for an 18-month loan.</p>

			<p>Both her watercolor work and acrylic paintings have been featured in the online publication Unlikely Stories.</p>
