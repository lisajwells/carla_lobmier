        <h1>Artwall on third</h1>

        <p class="page-intro"><strong><i>Scrolling Confluence: Supernova</i></strong> installed in <i>Art Wall on Third,</i> Mid-Manhattan Library, NYC, January through April, 2016, is a companion suite to Art in the Corner Room and consists of ten vertical rice paper scrolls. While each scroll is painted with watercolor, the compositions feature graphite drawing woven into the bursting watercolor paint. The content of this work is more personal and looks at the intuitive in making art and my own practice. Where do ideas come from and how do they burst into an artist’s imagery? How do these ideas expand to become communication with others? Are we aware of meaning as it is forming? Is there something akin to an animal’s instincts that drive the firing of the brain into acts of visual expression?</p>
